---------------------------------


1. Markets are everywhere.

2. Market dynamics are mental dynamics. They are totally under responsibility of social actors.

3. Through the markets, human's aims and intentions participate in structuring both natural and social environment.

4. Everyone accesses the necessary resources based on its market mission, respecting its constraints, in balance and harmony.

5. Markets are based on interactions between people who supervise the allocation of resources and their transformation, based on co-operative strategies and coherent aims.

6. Markets technology facilitates changement and continuous generation of opportunities through methods of effectiveness, efficiency and flexibility.

7. Markets organize human action in companies or businesses through complex cybernetic mechanisms according to the principles of mission, vision and planning.

8. Companies and businesses are everywhere and manifest themselves on the abstract mental plane as process organizations and on the concrete material level as interconnected structures.

9. Markets, companies and businesses self-organize themselves in a recursive architecture, creating a living and global technical-economic system.

10. Markets and companies partecipate in every human expression, both as a tool for socio-environmental regulation and as a means of physical, mental and spiritual realization of human persons.

11. The global performance of companies and markets, which are based on human work, is always excellent and it's all we can trust. This truth depends exclusively on social actors.

12. The complex system formed by companies, markets, and work is a great asset for Humanity. It's open, agile, elegant and free access for every person, no one excluded. A heritage of all, to be protected, promoted, developed and shared.
